### **Staff and Employee Research (OSINT Approac)**

Looking into a company’s **staff and employees,** especially on professional social media platforms like LinkedIn, can give us key insights into the technologies and infrastructure used within the organization.

By reviewing employee profiles and **job postings**, we can figure out:

- The **programming languages** they use (e.g., Python, Java, C#, PHP)
- Their preferred **databases** (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle)
- Which **frameworks** they work with (e.g., Flask, Django, Spring, ASP.NET)
- Their **development practices**, like Agile, Continuous Integration, and use of version control (e.g., Git, SVN)

### **What Job Posts Reveal**

A job posting might also list:

- Whether they use **Docker/Kubernetes** for containerization.
- Tools like **Jira, Confluence**, or **Bitbucket** from the Atlassian suite.
- Whether **security certifications** (like CompTIA Security+) are required.
- Any **software testing** tools or practices they follow.

All of this builds a **technology map** of the company—even without touching their systems.

### **What Employee Profiles Reveal**

On LinkedIn, employees often:

- **List their skills**, current projects, and tech stacks.
- Share content about what they’re working on.
- Link to **GitHub repositories**, where mis-configurations might be visible (e.g., exposed JWT tokens, hard-coded credentials, email addresses).

By analyzing these:

- We learn **how experienced** the developers are.
- We understand which **frameworks** (like Django or Flask) are used.
- We can even find **misc-onfigured code** in public repos and spot vulnerabilities like those mentioned in the **OWASP Top 10**.
