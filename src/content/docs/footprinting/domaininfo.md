Domain information is a key part of any penetration test. It’s not just about finding subdomains, it's about understanding the entire online presence of a company. We want to learn how the company works, what technologies it uses and how its services are structured to run smoothly and effectively.

This information is collected **passively**, meaning we don’t actively scan or directly interact with the company’s systems. Instead, we act like normal users or visitors to avoid revealing ourselves. This is part of **OSINT** (Open Source Intelligence), which helps us collect useful information without making any direct contact.

A good starting point is the company’s **main website**. Read through it carefully and think about what kind of technology might be behind the services they offer. For example, if the company provides app development, IoT, or hosting services, they likely use specific tools, platforms, or programming languages. Even if you're not familiar with a service, take time to research and understand it—this will help you understand how the company is built.

This stage is a mix of two key enumeration ideas:

- Look at what you **can see** (e.g., services listed on the website),
- And think about what you **can’t see** (e.g., how those services actually work behind the scenes).

To do this well, try to think like a **developer**—what tools or systems would you need to make this service work? This mindset helps you understand the technical side of the company and gives you deeper insight into its structure and potential weaknesses.
