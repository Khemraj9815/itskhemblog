**Nmap Scan**

```python

```

Found 4 ports open

lets check port 80, cause it provide more information compared to other port 

![image.png](../../../assets/Opacity/image%201.png)

ohh got login page!!! lets keep this aside and search for hidden directories

![image.png](../../../assets/Opacity/image%202.png)

there is nothing in the source code

since the web page provide more information to us and even the important document could be hidden. 

What I feel like is, when level increases we need more words for gubuster to find hidden directories

I am not able to upload the reverse shell file. But I can hide the file name extension. Lets do this.

```python

since there is image upload source, we can hide the reverse shell.

![image.png](../../../assets/Opacity/image%204.png)

as we can see here .php extension is not allowed 

![image.png](../../../assets/Opacity/image%205.png)

finally after trying for many times reverse shell is successful

![image.png](../../../assets/Opacity/image%206.png)

there  is a user sysadmin under home directory 

![image.png](../../../assets/Opacity/image%207.png)

permission denied!! we need higher privilege to see this file. I havenâ€™t sneak much, have to find all the possible way to get higher privilege.

After searching for many things, I saw one directory which could give some hints 

![image.png](../../../assets/Opacity/image%208.png)

I even downloaded file

```python
â”Œâ”€â”€(khemã‰¿kali)-[~]
â””â”€$ wget http://10.10.97.110:8080/dataset.kdbx

got the password to open the file.

this password is for user sysadmin which was found earlier. 

![image.png](../../../assets/Opacity/image%2014.png)

got into the port 22 as sysadmin. 

When I am lost I always prefer linpeas, since it scan all target thoroughly. 

[https://github.com/peass-ng/PEASS-ng/tree/master/linPEAS](https://github.com/peass-ng/PEASS-ng/tree/master/linPEAS)

I have left a reference here

When I ran the [linpeas.sh](http://linpeas.sh) it is

![image.png](../../../assets/Opacity/image%2017.png)

```php
<?php

//Backup of scripts sysadmin folder
require_once('lib/backup.inc.php');
zipData('/home/sysadmin/scripts', '/var/backups/backup.zip');
echo 'Successful', PHP_EOL;

//Files scheduled removal
$dir = "/var/www/html/cloud/images";
if(file_exists($dir)){
    $di = new RecursiveDirectoryIterator($dir, FilesystemIterator::SKIP_DOTS);
    $ri = new RecursiveIteratorIterator($di, RecursiveIteratorIterator::CHILD_FIRST);
    foreach ( $ri as $file ) {
        $file->isDir() ?  rmdir($file) : unlink($file);
    }
}
?>
```

what this code does

- back up the /home/sysadmin/scripts folder into zip archive located at /var/backups/backup.zip
- deletes all the files and subdirectories in /var/www/html/cloud/images if the directory exists0

### Final Thought

Same as all the roomðŸ”¥! I learned new ways to escalate privilege.
